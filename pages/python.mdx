## Using python

Below are example get and post requests using python.

### Request

GET

```python copy filename="python"
import requests

# Define the headers
headers = {
  "X-API-KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

# Define the URL you want to send the GET request to
url = "https://api.srating.io/v1/cbb_game/getGames?start_date=2023-04-01&organization_id=f1c37c98-3b4c-11ef-94bc-2a93761010b8&division_id=bf602dc4-3b4a-11ef-94bc-2a93761010b8"

# Send the GET request with the headers
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# Check the status code to ensure the request was successful (200 OK)
if response.status_code == 200:
  # Print the response content
  print(response.text)
else:
  print(f"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
```
